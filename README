This is the development trunk of Openbravo ERP.

* Installation

First run the setup binary corresponding to your system in the
config directory. For example in x86 Linux:

  ./setup-properties-linux.bin

If there is no setup binary for your operating system and architecture,
send a request to <jar at openbravo dot com>.

Then, to install it run:

  ant install.source

It creates the database structure, builds the core, compiles
Openbravo and generates a war file.

Deploy this war file into the tomcat/webapps directory.
