If the document type of your document has no automatic document sequence defined, the field is empty if you create a new document. This is for documents which usually have an external number (like vendor invoice).  If you leave the field empty, the system will generate a document number for you. The document sequence used for this fallback number is defined in the "Maintain Sequence" window with the name "DocumentNo_&lt;TableName&gt;", where TableName is the actual name of the table (e.g. C_Order).</value></row><row id="1082" trl="Y"><value column="Name" original="Document Status">Estado do Documento</value><value column="Description" original="The current status of the document">The current status of the document</value><value column="Help" original="The Document Status indicates the status of a document at this time.
