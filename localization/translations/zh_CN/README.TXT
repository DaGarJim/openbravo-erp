Welcome to the Openbravo Chinese translation

To import a language you should log into the application as System Administrator. Go to General Rules -> System Rules -> Language -> and check your language as "System Language". Save changes and press the "Verify language" button. Then go to General Rules > System Rules > Import/Export Translations, select your language and press "Import". The desired language XML files must be in the following directory: "ATTACHMENTS/lang/zh_CN"

* In the installation process, you are asked to name the ATTACHMENTS folder so this might be different in your case

* it_IT should be replaced with the code for your particular language 

Then go to your root Openbravo folder and type "ant compile.complete"
